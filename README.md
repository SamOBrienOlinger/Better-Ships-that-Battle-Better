### **Original Battleship Logic**
Core game board logic adapted from [Garrett Broughton's Battleship](https://github.com/gbrough/battleship):

```python
def get_letters_to_numbers():
    letters_to_numbers = {"A": 0, "B": 1, "C": 2, "D": 3, "E": 4, "F": 5, "G": 6, "H": 7}
    return letters_to_numbers

def print_board(self):
    print("  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8")
    print("  A B C D E F G H")
    print("  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+")
    row_number = 1
    for row in self.board:
        print("%d|%s|" % (row_number, "|".join(row)))
        row_number += 1
```
