# Custom Username Validation - Testing Guide

## What Was Changed

The Django User model's default username validation has been customized to allow **any characters** in usernames, removing the default restriction of "Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only."

## Files Modified

1. **`pirates/auth_forms.py`** - New file with custom authentication forms
2. **`better_ships_that_battle_better/views.py`** - Updated to use custom forms

## What Usernames Are Now Allowed

### ✅ Previously FORBIDDEN usernames that now WORK

- `Captain O'Malley` (apostrophe)
- `José María` (accented characters)
- `王船長` (Chinese characters)
- `Капитан Пират` (Cyrillic characters)
- `Captain-Anne-Bonny` (multiple hyphens)
- `★☠️ Pirate Queen ☠️★` (emojis and symbols)
- `user@domain.com` (email-like format)
- `Pirate #1` (hash/pound symbol)
- `Cap'n Jack & Co.` (ampersand and period)
- `username with spaces` (spaces)

### ✅ Still VALIDATED for

- **Maximum length**: 150 characters
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate usernames (case-insensitive check)
- **Not empty**: Cannot be just whitespace
- **Required field**: Must provide a username

## Testing the Changes

### Test Case 1: Unicode Characters

1. Go to the registration page
2. Try username: `船長王`
3. Should work successfully

### Test Case 2: Special Symbols

1. Try username: `Pirate★Queen☠️`
2. Should work successfully

### Test Case 3: Spaces and Punctuation

1. Try username: `Captain O'Malley & Crew`
2. Should work successfully

### Test Case 4: Mixed Characters

1. Try username: `José María #1 Pirate!`
2. Should work successfully

### Test Case 5: Validation Still Works

1. Try empty username: (blank)
2. Should show error: "Username is required."
3. Try duplicate username
4. Should show error: "A user with that username already exists."

## Benefits

1. **International Users**: Users can use their native languages
2. **Creative Freedom**: More expressive usernames possible
3. **Accessibility**: Better for users with non-English keyboards
4. **User Experience**: Removes frustrating character restrictions

## Implementation Details

The custom validation:

- Allows any Unicode characters
- Maintains security by checking length and uniqueness
- Preserves exact case as entered by user
- Uses case-insensitive duplicate checking for better UX
- Provides clear error messages

## Security Notes

- Username uniqueness is still enforced
- Length limits prevent database issues
- Authentication remains secure
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities introduced
